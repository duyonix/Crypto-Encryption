# the oscars turn  on sunday which seems about right after this long strange
# awards trip the bagger feels like a nonagenarian too

# the awards race was bookended by the demise of harvey weinstein at its outset
# and the apparent implosion of his film company at the end and it was shaped by
# the emergence of metoo times up blackgown politics armcandy activism and

# extra long because the oscars were moved to the first weekend in march to
# avoid conflicting with the closing ceremony of the winter olympics thanks
